# Course Archive

This repo includes the syllabi for the courses I have taught over the years. (At least all of those that I still had after a couple computer crashes.)

If you are looking for others, try contacting the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/); they tend to have many of these on file, although I don't know how far back they keep them.
