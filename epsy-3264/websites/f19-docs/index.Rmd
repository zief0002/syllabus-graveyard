### Course Content and Syllabus {-}

EPsy 3264 is designed to engage students using a modeling and simulation approach to inference. This course uses pedagogical principles that are founded in research, such as daily small group activities and discussion. Upon completion of this course, students should have an understanding of the foundational concepts of data, variation and inference, as well as an appreciation for the fundamental role that statistics plays in a host of disciplines, such as business, economics, law, and medicine.

- The course syllabus is available  [here](https://github.com/zief0002/epsy-3264/raw/master/2019-fall-epsy-3264-zieffler.pdf).

<br />

### Course Materials {-}

- The course textbook, which includes the out-of-class readings, is available online at http://zief0002.github.io/statistical-thinking/.

- You will work from the lab manual, *Statistical Thinking 4.2: A Simulation Approach to Modeling Uncertainty*, every day in class. [Click here to download a PDF copy of the lab manual.](https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking/blob/master/statistical-thinking-v4_2.pdf?raw=true) You will need to bring the lab manual to class with you every day.

- There are several data sets used in the lab manual, as well as in EPSY 3264
assignments. [Click here to download a ZIP file to your computer that includes all the data sets.](https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking/blob/master/data.zip?raw=true) Once the ZIP file has been downloaded to your computer, double-click the ZIP file to unzip it and access the materials.

- Much of the material presented in the lab manual requires the use of TinkerPlots&trade;. This software can be downloaded (for Mac or PC), and a license can be purchased from http://www.tinkerplots.com/. Note, since this software needs to be installed, it will not work on a Chromebook or other notebooks that only run web apps.

<br />

### TinkerPlots on Campus{-}

TinkerPlots is installed on four computers in the [Walter Library](https://campusmaps.umn.edu/walter-library) computer lab (WALIB 105; Computers 18&ndash;21). These computers are marked with a sign indicating that TinkerPlots is installed on them.
