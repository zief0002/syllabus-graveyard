Wine Classification Data
Apr. 16, 2012


These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. These are a subset of those variables.

1) Type: class 1 (n = 59); class 2 (n = 71); class 3 (n = 48)
2) Color: Color intensity
3) Hue
4) Alcohol: Concentration of alchohol
