BACKGROUND

Jones-White, Radcliffe, Lorenz, and Soria (in review) examined the influence of financial aid packaging on the probability of students’ success in college using a multinomial regression model to predict a student’s success (measured as: graduate from institution of entry, graduate from a transfer institution, or depart from college) controlling for several demographic factors. Jones-White, D., Radcliffe, P., Lorenz, L., & Soria, K.
