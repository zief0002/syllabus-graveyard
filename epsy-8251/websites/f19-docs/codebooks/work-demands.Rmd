Research has documented the importance of a healthy work-life balance. The data in [work-demands.csv](https://github.com/zief0002/epsy-8251/raw/master/data/work-demands.csv) were simulated to mimic the effects of boundary-spanning work (receiving work-related contact outside of normal work hours) found in the literature on psychological outcomes. The variables in the data are:

- `guilt`: Measure of guilt (as a transitory affective state) related to home-life balance; the survey item used to measure this was, "In the past seven days, on how many  days  have  you  felt  guilty?" Higher values indicate more perceived guilt.
- `distress`: Measure of psychological distress; sum score for four items asking participants about the number of days (in the past seven) that they (1) "felt  that  everything was an effort," (2) "felt tired or run down," (3) "had trouble  keeping your  mind on what you were doing,", and (4) "felt you couldn't get going.". Higher values indicate more distress.
- `bound_span_work`: Measure of boundary-spanning work demands; the survey item asked participants "how  often  do  coworkers,  supervisors, managers, customers, or clients contact you about work-related  matters  outside  normal  work  hours?" (0 = never; 1 = less than once a month; 2 = once a week; 3 = several times a week; 4 = once or more times a day). Higher values indicate higher degrees of boundary-spanning work demands
- `female`: Dummy-coded indicator of sex (0 = male; 1 = female)
- `authority`: Measure of job authority; sum of four survey items: (1) "Do you influence or set the rate of pay  received  by  others?"; (2) "Do you have  the authority to hire or fire others?"; (3) "Do you supervise or manage anyone as part of your job?"; and (4)  "if 'yes' to Question 3, "Do  any  of  those individuals supervise or manage others?". Higher values indicate more authority.
