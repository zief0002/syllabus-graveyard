# Understanding the Basic Syntax

Plots are built by *layering* different components. 


```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

In this syntax there are three layers:

1. a global layer, 
2. a geometric layer, and 
3. a theme layer. 

The layers are literally *summed* together to form the plot.


---

# The Global Layer

The first layer (referred to as the global layer) is always `ggplot()`. It contains reference to the source data (data frame object) and any *global aesthetic mappings*. The first layer only sets up the plot, it doesn’t actually plot anything. (In the subsequent layers, we add geometric objects (e.g., points, boxplots), themes, etc.)


```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
```

- The `data=` argument indicates the source data frame.
- The `aes=` argument sets the aesthetic mapping(s).

---

# Adding Geometric Objects

Geometric objects are features that are actually drawn on plot (e.g., lines, points). They are specified using the prefix `geom_` and a suffix that names the feature to be plotted.

.pull-left[.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) + 
  geom_point()
```

- **Points** specified with `geom_point()`
- **Jittered points** specified with `geom_jitter()`
- **Lines** specified with `geom_line()`
- **Boxplots** specified with `geom_boxplot()`
]]

# Aesthetic Mappings

Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the data are **mapped to visual properties** (aesthetics) in the plot. They are used to define visual properties such as: position (e.g., `\(x\)`-dimension, `\(y\)`-dimension), size, color, fill, and groupings.


```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point()
```

In this example there are two aesthetic mappings.

1. Education values from the data are mapped to the `\(x\)`-position for each observation.
2. Income values from the data are mapped to the `\(y\)`-position for each observation.

All aesthetic mappings (data mapped to visual property) need to be specified in the `aes()` function. Mappings apply different values for the visual property based on the data. The geometric objects (in this example, points) are plotted based on the aesthetic mappings specified in the global layer. For example, the syntax above draws points at the ordered pairs of employees’ education ($x$-position) and incomes ($y$-position) as specified in the `city` data.

---

# Adding Layers

When layers are added they are "stacked" on top of previous layers. Imagine drawings on separate transparencies, and then those transparencies are stacked. 

.pull-left[.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

Here the `geom_smooth()` layer (which adds a loess smoother) is drawn ON TOP of the points, which are added in the `geom_point()` layer.

]

---

# Good Syntactic Habits

As we add multiple layers to build up our plot, it is a good habit to use multiple lines for the syntax. Generally we put one layer on each line. 


```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_bw()
```

The `+` sign needs to be at the end of the line (not at the beginning). If you are using a script file (which you should be), highlight ALL layers in the plot and click `Run` to create the plot.

---

# Global vs. Local Aesthetic Mappings

Aesthetic mappings can be set globally (in `ggplot()` layer) or locally (set in a specific layer). Aesthetic mappings that are set in the `ggplot()` layer are applied to *all layers* in the plot; they are global. Aesthetic mappings set in a specific layer only apply to that particular layer.

.pull-left[.smallisher[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income, color = gender)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

]]


---

# Fixed Aesthetics

Fixed aesthetics assign the exact same value for the visual property for **all** the observations; it is not based on the data. Fixed aesthetics are specified outside the `aes()` function. For example, the following syntax uses the data to assign the `\(x\)`- and `\(y\)`-positions (aesthetic mapping), but then colors *all of the observations* red and makes *all of the observations* size 4 (default is `size=3`).

.pull-left[.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 4) +

- How would we color the points by political party?

&lt;img src="03-plotting-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="50%" /&gt;

---

# Useful Point Aesthetics

Two other useful aesthetics for points are `shape=` and `size=` for plotting the shapes and sizes of points, respectively. 

.pull-left[.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = party, shape = gender), size = 4)
```
]]

.pull-right[
![](03-plotting-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

Notice when we use non-positional aesthetic mappings (e.g., color, shape) a legend will be automatically added to our plot for each aesthetic mapping.

---

# Faceting: Separate Plots for Subgroups

.pull-left[
Faceting creates a separate plot for each subgroup declared. To facet on a single predictor use the `facet_wrap()` layer. The wiggle/tilde (`~`) sets the predictor for facetting on.

.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ party, nrow = 2)
```
]


]

.pull-right[
![](03-plotting-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]
---

# Facetting on Multiple Variables

.pull-left[
When facetting on multiple predictors, use `facet_grid(rows ~ columns)`

.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(party ~ gender)
```
]
]

&lt;img src="03-plotting-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="90%" /&gt;
]

---

# Changing the Axis Label

The layers `xlab()` and `ylab()` can be used to change the label on the `\(x\)`- and `\(y\)`-axes, respectively.

.pull-left[
.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Education level (in years)") +
  ylab("Income level (in U.S. dollars)")
```
]
]

.pull-right[
![](03-plotting-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Changing the Axis Limits

The layers `xlim()` and `ylim()` are used to set the limits on the `\(x\)`-axis and `\(y\)`-axis, respectively. The first value provided is the minimum, and the second value given is the maximum.

.pull-left[
.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Education level (in years)") +
  ylab("Income level (in U.S. dollars)") +
  xlim(0, 30) +
  ylim(0, 100000)
```
]
]

.pull-right[
![](03-plotting-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

---

# Fine-Tuning Axis Scales

The `xlab()`, `ylab()`, `xlim()` and `ylim()` functions we used are shortcuts to using scaling layers. The use of scaling layers allows much more fine-tuning and control of the axis scales. There are four different scaling functions you can use depending on which axis ($x$ or `\(y\)`) you want to control and whether the variable plotted along that axis is *continuous* or *discrete*. The four functions are: (1) `scale_x_continuous()`, (2) `scale_x_discrete()`, (2) `scale_y_continuous()`, and (4) `scale_y_discrete()`.


```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "Education level (in years)",
    breaks = c(10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24)
  )
```

The `name=` option labels the scale (it is the same as the `xlab()` layer in this case). The `breaks=` option adds break lines on the axis. There are several other options including `labels=` for labelling the break lines, etc.

---

# Customizing the Color

Scaling functions can also be used to fine-tune colors and fills. For these you need to specify either color or fill, and also the palette you want to use. For example, `scale_color_manual()` can be used to manually set the colors when the `color=` aesthetic mapping is used. 

.pull-left[
.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = seniority, y = education)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = party)) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("#00afbb", "#e7b800", "#fc4e07")
  )
```
]

Here, `scale_color_manual()` allows you to manually set the attributes associated with the `color=` aesthetic mapping. The `values=` argument sets the color values for each level of the party variable. 
]

.pull-right[
![](03-plotting-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

# Customizing the Legend

Scaling functions can also be used to change the name and labels in the legend. 

.pull-left[
.smallish[

```r
ggplot(data = city, aes(x = seniority, y = education)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = party)) +
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Political affiliation",
    values = c("#00afbb", "#e7b800", "#fc4e07"),
    labels = c("Dem", "Ind", "Rep")
  )
```
]

The `name=` argument changes the title of the legend, and the `labels=` argument allows you to modify the labels.

# Specifying Colors: Named Colors

# Specifying Colors: HEX

Colors can also be defined using HEX notation. HEX notation is always preceeded by a hashtag (\#).

# Choosing a Color Palette

.pull-left[
Choosing a color palette can be challenging. It should be aesthetically pleasing, but needs to convey the differences and nuances in the data that you are using color to display. In addition, roughly 8% of males and 0.5% of females have some form of color vision deficiency which will affect how they see and interpret the plot. Here are a few resources for thinking about color palettes:

- [Finding the Right Color Palettes for Data Visualizations](https://blog.graphiq.com/finding-the-right-color-palettes-for-data-visualizations-fcd4e707a283)
- [Picking a Colour Scale for Scientific Graphics](https://betterfigures.org/2015/06/23/picking-a-colour-scale-for-scientific-graphics/)
- [Color Universal Design (CUD): How to Make Figures and Presentations that are Friendly to Colorblind People](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/)
]

.pull-right[
Many organizations have official colors associated with their brand. For example, the University of Minnesota's two official primary colors in HEX (for electronic display) are:

- `#ffcc33` (gold)
- `#7a0019` (maroon)
