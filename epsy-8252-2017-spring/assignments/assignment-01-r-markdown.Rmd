In this assignment you will use R Markdown to produce an HTML or PDF file that includes your responses to each of the questions on this assignment. Please adhere to the following guidelines for further formatting your assignment: 

- All graphics should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary and should have an appropriate caption. Learn how to do this in a code chunk using [knitr syntax](http://yihui.name/knitr/).
- Any typed mathematics (equations, matrices, vectors, etc.) should be appropriately typeset within the document using Markdown's display equations. See [here](http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/courses/m343/F12/RStudio/LatexExamples.html) for some examples of how mathematics can be typeset in R Markdown.
- All syntax should be hidden (i.e., not displayed) unless specifically asked for. Any messages or warnings produced from loading packages should also be hidden.

For each question, specify the question number using a section header. Submit your HTML (or PDF) file and your RMD file via email that you send to both Jonathan and Andy.

For this assignment, you will be using data from the file *FCI-2015.csv*. These data include information from the 2015 (or 2015/2016) season for 122 professional sports teams across the United States and the stadiums these teams play in. The variables are:

- `team`: Name of professional sports team
- `fci`: Fan Cost Index (FCI). The FCI is a summary of what it costs to take a family of four to a game. It comprises the prices of four (4) adult average-price tickets, two (2) small draft beers, four (4) small soft drinks, four (4) regular-size hot dogs, parking for one (1) car, two (2) game programs and two (2) least expensive, adult-size adjustable caps.
- `league`: Major sporting league the team plays in (MLB = Major Lague Baseball; NBA = National Basketball Association; NFL = National Football League; NHL = National Hockey League)
- `stadium`: Teamâ€™s home stadium
- `yearOpened`: Year the stadium was opened
- `capacity`: Stadium's seating capacity

In this assignment, you are going to focus on predicting variation in the cost of going to a game (FCI) using differences in sporting league.

- **Question 1:** Read in the data and show the results using the `head()` function. All syntax for these commands should be displayed, as should the output.

- **Question 2:** Create dummy variables for each of the leagues represented in the data. Again, show the results using the `head()` function. Display only the output from the `head()` function. In text, not R syntax, also identify the reference league. 

- **Question 3:** Use the `lm()` function to fit the linear model regressing FCI on your league dummies. Use the `glance()` function from the *broom* package to display the model's summary output. (Reminder: Do not display any syntax, only the output.)

- **Question 4:** Use an unordered list to provide an interpretation of each regression coefficient, one per list item.

\newpage

- **Question 5:** Use the `tidy()` function from the *broom* package to create a table of the model's coefficient output. This table should then be outputted as an HTML formatted table (or LaTeX formatted if producing a PDF file). In the final outputted table, the five column names should be "Predictor", "B", "SE", "t", and "p", respectively. All numercial output should be rounded to two decimal places, except the $p$-values, which should be rounded to three decimal places. Also add an appropriate caption. One way to create such a table is to use the `xtable()` function from the *xtable* package. Another way is to use the `kable()` function from the *knitr* package. Find out about them using Google.

- **Question 6:** Create a scatterplot of the FCI (outcome) versus league. In this plot, color the observations by league, and also display each of the four horixontal lines that are defined from the fitted regression. These lines should also be colored so they correspond to the appropriate league. Display the plot, but not the syntax. The plot should be centered on the slide and should have an appropriate caption. The figure should be 500 pixels wide x 400 pixels tall. (If outputting to a PDF file, make the appropriate coversions to inches or cm.)

- **Question 7:** Use a display equation to write the equation for the underlying regression model (including error) using greek letters, subscripts, and variable names. Also write the equation for the fitted least squares regression equation based on the output from `lm()`. Type these two equations in the same display equation, each on a separate line of text in your slide, and align the equals signs. (Hint: Google "aligning math latex".)

- **Question 8:** Use an inline equation to write the following sentence: "The estimated coefficient ($\beta_\mathrm{NHL}$) is $x$. In this sentence, replace $x$ with the value for the fitted coeffcient from the fitted equation. Do not just write in the value for the coefficient in the sentence, but pull it from the `coef()` or `summary()`output, and add it using an inline code chunk.

- **Question 9:** Compute the sum of squared residuals for the fitted regression. Although you can use the `anova()` function to check your work, compute this value by actually using R syntax to carry out the computation, $\sum(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$.

- **Question 10:** Write a sentence that includes two references in an inline citation. This should also generate the actual references when you knit your slides. One of the two references should be the Fox textbook. The other should be a journal article of your choice. You can choose the topic of the sentence and how the two references are used in the citation. (Note the references do not actually have to pertain to what is written in the sentence. This is just an exercise in using the bibliography tools in Markdown.) The two references can be include in the document's YAML (be careful of the indentation) *or* drawn from an external BIB file. (If you use a BIB file, also email that when you turn in your assignment.) Specify an appropriate CSL file so that the references and citations are in APA format. (If you want to use a citation style that is different from APA, say for a specific journal, use the appropriate CSL file, and indicate that on the assignment.)
