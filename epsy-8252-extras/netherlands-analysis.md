* Snijders & Bosker (1999), Multilevel Analysis, in        *;
* chapters 4 and 5, provide several useful examples of     *;
* linear mixed models for data collected on students       *;
* from a number of different schools.  Tom Snijders has    *;
* made this data available on his website and the analysis *;
* of this data will be the focus of this exercise.         *;
*                                                          *;
* The data is from 2287 grade 8 pupils in 131 schools in   *;
* The Netherlands 1988.  While the structure of the data   *;
* is students nested within classrooms within schools,     *;
* only one classroom was included per school for these     *;
* analyses, such that classroom and school are isomorphic. *;
* Given this, a 2-level model is appropriate.  The data    *;
* includes scores on a language test (LangPOST) which is   *;
* the primary dependent variable as well as data on the    *;
* student level predictors verbal IQ (IQverb) and socio-   *;
* economic status (SES).  Classroom level predictors of    *;
* interest are the size of the class (groupsiz), whether   *;
* the class includes students from different grade levels  *;
* (mixedgra: if the class includes both 7th and 8th grade  *;
* students then mixedgra=1, else mixedgra=0), and the mean *;
* IQ of the 8th grade students in the class (MeanIQ).      *;
*                                                          *;
* All predictors except mixedgra will be mean-centered in  *;
* the analyses.                                            *;
*                                                          *; 
* For this exercise, you are to replicate Snijder's        *;
* analyses by running multilevel models to address the     *;
* following:                                               *;
*    1. What % of variance in language scores is           *;
*       attributable to differences between classrooms?    *;
*    2. Are language scores related to verbal IQ?          *;
*    3. Is there evidence for classroom differences in the *;
*       effect of verbal IQ on language test scores?       *;                                       *;
*    4. Is the average level of the language scores in the *;
*       classroom related to the average verbal IQ of the  *;
*       students within that classroom?                    *;
*    5. Do smart kids do better when surrounded by smart   *;
*       peers?  That is, is the effect of child verbal IQ  *;
*       stronger for students in classes with higher mean  *;
*       IQ?                                                *;
*    6. Add SES as a level 1 predictor and add groupsiz    *;
*       and mixedgra as level 2 predictors.  Allow SES to  *;
*       have a random effect and predict each of the       *;
*       random effects of the level 1 variables by the     *;
*       full set of level 2 predictors. Interpret the      *;
*       results of this model.                             *;
*                                                          *;
* Given sufficient time, run the same models as above in   *;
* SAS PROC REG assuming no random effects (independence of *;
* observations. Evaluate the degree of change in the       *;
* fixed effects estimates and their standard errors.       *;
* Consider the additional information present in the mixed *;
* modeling results.                                        *;
