Data
=========

These are the data sets used in class and for the homework assignments.



### Can I download a Single Data Set?

Yes. Click on the data set. Then click the `RAW` button. Now you should be able to right-click the dataset and save it. If you are using Safari on a Mac, make sure that the downloaded data does not have an extra *.txt* appended to it. If it does, just delete the extra *.txt* suffix.
